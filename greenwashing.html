                Greenwashing is when a company or organisation tries to appear to be more environmentally friendly than it really is. They might exaggerate the positive impacts of their product/service, or even say it is beneficial to the planet when it is harmful! Greenwashing includes brands claiming to have eco-friendly values while carrying on with their usual destructive practices.

            <h3>
                How do companies greenwash?
            </h3>

            <p>
                Some classic methods of greenwashing are listed below:

                <ul>
                    <li><u>Using green colours and pictures of nature</u> animals, and green packaging are a deceptive way of making something look eco-friendly when it might not be!</li>
                    <li><u>Over-simplifying problems or leaving information out</u>It seems great that your plastic water bottle is 100% recyclable, but only 9% of plastic is ever recycled globally. (1) Even if your bottle is lucky enough to be in that 9%, it is not going to be turned into new bottles! Plastic is ‘downcycled’ because the quality of the material gets reduced each time it is recycled</li>
                    <li><u>Carbon offsetting by tree planting</u>Planting trees – if done in the right way – is brilliant for the planet. But using it as a ‘Get Out of Jail’ card to keep doing business as usual and pass the responsibility onto someone else doesn’t get to the root of the problem. See this about ‘Phantom Forests’ for more detail:<br> <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-61300708">https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-61300708</a></li>
                    <li><u>Using words like ‘Eco’ and ‘All Natural’ on packaging</u>Unlike well-known brands such as Fairtrade, there is no agreed meaning of these words, and anyone can use them.</li>
                    <li><u>Only focusing on issues that have already been solved.</u>Companies are eager to tell you how many plastic straws they have saved, using these kinds of statistics as a distraction from the bigger problems at hand</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h3>
                Why do companies greenwash?
            </h3>

            <p>
                Greenwashing can be done by accident or intentionally. Sustainability is a very complex issue that is about more than just your carbon footprint. It also involves materials, pollution, water usage, biodiversity loss, ethics, and more! The global supply chain is highly interconnected, and it is hard to trace where products have come from, especially for consumers. There is a lack of information surrounding carbon emissions for both the public and firms.  Words like 'ethical' have no universal definition and are ambiguous. This means it can be easy to make mistakes and genuinely believe your product/service is less environmentally damaging than it is. <br><br>
                Unfortunately, there is also a darker side to greenwashing that involves intentional lying to mislead and manipulate the public. Some organisations spend huge amounts of money on marketing to spread false information and purposely distract from the harm they are causing. For example, oil giants Shell and BP are well known for hiding their destructive practices behind fancy adverts focusing on renewable energy.<br><br>
                Companies greenwash because they want to win consumers’ approval, whilst protecting their profits as much as possible. They also might use it to appeal to new markets of people who wouldn’t usually buy their product/service. The sad truth is that intentional greenwashing is purely driven by a desire to make money by whatever means – even if that includes exploiting people and the planet.
