# Kocoon
Kocoon is an educational platform that focuses on the wellbeing by presenting academic papers for everyone.

I designed and developed version 1.0 of the fully responsive website. This website uses HTML, SASS, JavaScript & Responsive Design.

Furture updates to this website will continue as time goes on

# Lessons Learned

I really enjoyed the process of breaking down the website that I had to make, via divide and conquer. The lessons learned are below:

* Re-creating a website as close as possible to the design that I made.
* (updating my knowledge on) Responsive Design.
* Adding favicon to a page.
* Creating a website ASAP.
* Flexbox & layouts.

# Challenges

* There wasn't a UI/UX design, so I had to learn design skills
* Updating my knowledge on responsive design.
* Looking for ways to minimise the amount of code that I write
