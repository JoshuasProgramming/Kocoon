            <h3>What is Exercise and Sports Science?</h3>

            <p>
                Sports science is the study of how the human body responds to physical activity and how sport and exercise benefit mental and physical health. It covers the information, techniques, and applications of the various subfields of human movement studies, such as exercise physiology, biomechanics, motor control and motor development, exercise psychology, and sports psychology, as well as how these fields interconnect.
                <br><br>
                Sports and exercise science helps to separate reality from fiction in a world of craze fitness trends using in-depth analysis, and performance testing/measurement. In spite of the fact that sport and exercise science continue to make new discoveries and advances our understanding of the human body in motion, a lot of false information persists in the fitness industry.
                <br><br>
                Always verify the information you find on commercial websites. The World Health Organization (WHO), the National Biotechnology Information Center (NCBI), and the American College of Sports Medicine (ASCM) are a few reputable informational sources.

                5 Common Myths in Exercise and sports science
            </h3>

                <li>Myth. You can spot train body areas for fat burn.</li>
                <p>Targeting specific areas to burn fat is a myth. Spot training is ineffective because your body draws its energy from fat across the entire body rather than from the place that is being used to produce a motion. For instance, when you perform a sit-up, the abdominal muscles are used to carry out the motion, but the energy source isn't always drawn from your belly. Rather, your body draws energy (fat) from all throughout your body to fuel the core muscles used in sit-ups. The same logic applies as to why waist trainers are ineffective for spot reduction. Even while you may sweat in one area of your body, that doesn't necessarily mean that the energy used to produce the sweat is coming from that place.
                </p>

                <li>Myth. No Pain No Gain</li>
                <p>Coaches and parents frequently tell their student-athletes that "no pain, no gain." It is untrue to believe that if your muscles aren't in pain, you're not exercising hard enough. When you exercise, it's normal to experience some soreness in your muscles, but true pain is neither normal nor good. In fact, discomfort is a sign of a healthy physiological adaptation and is completely natural. When you exercise, it's common to experience burning or fatigue in your muscles. Always perform every workout with proper form since it is crucial. This will not only assist you in getting the desired physical outcomes but also lower your chance of injury.
                </p>
                <li>Myth. If you gain weight, that means you're getting fat.</li>
                <p>Your weight may remain constant when you initially start exercising. And perhaps more shockingly, it might also go up. Even while witnessing this in real-time could be horrifying, there is no need to be concerned. Most likely, your body is simply gaining muscle, which results in weight gain. You are actually gaining weight but still losing fat if the weight you gain in muscle does not offset the weight you lose in fat. The scale won't change if you lose 10 pounds of fat and develop 10 pounds of muscle, according to Roberta Anding, a registered dietician and assistant professor at Baylor University's Joseph Barnhart Department of Orthopaedic Surgery. A standard scale might not be your buddy if your objective is to decrease body fat and build muscle. You can assess changes in body composition better with the help of advanced body composition tools that calculate your body's proportions of fat, muscle, bone, and water.
                </p>
                <li>Myth. You need to eat as much protein as possible</li>
                <p>A high-protein diet can be advantageous, but only to a certain extent. More than 30 to 40 grams of protein cannot be absorbed by an individual at one time, according to research. Any excess will either be converted to fat or broken down and used as energy. In order to meet your needs without having to compromise on other nutrients like essential fats, fibre, vitamins, and minerals, it is preferable to aim for 30-35 percent of your calories to come from protein.
                </p>
                <li>Myth. Children should not lift weights since it will impede their growth.</li>
                <p>Resistance training is hazardous and detrimental to children's developing skeletons, according to one of the most pervasive fallacies surrounding children's fitness programmes. These antiquated beliefs regrettably still exist today, and several parents are unsure whether kids should lift weights. No scientific data suggests that participating in a well-developed kid resistance training programme will cause youngsters to grow more slowly or impair their growing skeleton. In fact, it appears that childhood is the optimal age to engage in activities that increase bone mineral content and density. Regular involvement in youth resistance training can positively impact bone growth and development in both girls and boys when done under expert supervision and with a logical escalation of training weights.
