                Anxiety is an overwhelming feeling of worry that everyone has experienced at a point in their lifetime. It is inevitable and part of being human. However, for some this intense state of worry can be difficult to regulate and can hinder daily life. How can you take control of this disorder?
            </p>

            </div>

            <p>
                In this article, we will be exploring what Anxiety is, the <u>symptoms</u>, <u>causes</u> and <u>treatments</u>. 
                <br><br>
                As mentioned before anxiety is part of the human experience, and everyone experiences it for moments at a time. For example, the worried feeling you get before boarding a theme park ride, before an important test or before a public-speaking event. Once you have gone on the ride, written that important test and finished speaking that feeling of anxiety is relieved.
                <br><br>
                However, for others, that feeling of anxiety does not go away and they struggle to gain control of their intense feeling of worry, thus leading to constant experiences of anxiety.
            </p>

            <h3>
                What is anxiety?
            </h3>

            <p>
                The National Health Service (NHS) describes anxiety as a feeling of unease, which can range from mild to severe. 
                <br><br>
                The causes of anxiety are unknown; however, it has been contested by researchers that rather than one single cause, it is a combination of varied factors. Meaning an individual may hold biological dispositions (i.e., hereditary traits or genetics) which react when exposed to negative life events. Additionally, usage of recreational drugs and health problems may also contribute to anxiety.
                <br><br>
                Anxiety can be daunting however, with the correct tools and support, there are ways individuals can cope and reduce their anxiety.
            </p>

            <h3>
                Types
            </h3>

            <p>
                There are variations of anxiety disorders, all with different symptoms and ranges of negative thoughts associated with them.
                <br>

                <ul>
                    <li><u>Phobias</u> – is the most common anxiety disorder. Phobias are an irrational fear of certain objects, situations, or animals. Feelings of increased levels of fear coincide with Phobias.</li>
                    <li><u>Panic disorders</u> – panic disorders are unexpected and frequent panic attacks. This may lead to excessive concern, fear, and anxiety about future attacks.</li>
                    <li><u>Social Anxiety</u> – is an intense fear of social situations and interacting with others. Deep fears of negative judgement from peers and fear of exposing oneself in public.</li>
                    <li><u>Generalised Anxiety Disorder (GAD)</u> – instead of a singular trigger for the feeling of anxiety, that are several that have strong effects on the individual’s health, social and professional life. </li>
                    <li><u>Separation Anxiety Disorder</u>– is prominent in both children and adults. It involves feelings of intense anxiety at being separated from someone you share a close bond with. </li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h3>
                Symptoms
            </h3>

            <p>
                The feelings that manifest whilst experiencing anxiety is the product of our sympathetic nervous system triggering our fight or flight response. When our fight-or-flight response is prolonged it may lead to an increased volume of stress hormones in the bloodstream, increased blood pressure, fat build-up and chronic stress that can cause harm to the body.
                <br><br>
                There are both psychological (mental) and physical symptoms. They are as follows:

                <ul>
                    <li>Shortness of breath</li>
                    <li>Increased heart rate</li>
                    <li>Upset stomach/nausea</li>
                    <li>Dry mouth</li>
                    <li>Feeling of dizziness</li>
                    <li>A feeling of dread/panic</li>
                    <li>Sweating</li>
                    <li>Restlessness/Fatigue</li>
                    <li>Physical weakness</li>
                    <li>Muscle tension</li>
                    <li>Poor Memory</li>
                    <li>Confusion</li>
                    <li>Disassociation </li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h3>
                Treatment
            </h3>

            <h4>
                Self Help
            </h4>

            <p>
                A GP often recommends self-help remedies for anxiety and panic disorder, as these remedies are usually readily available and there is a chance they could help relieve symptoms.
                <br><br>
                Self-help treatments may include: 
                
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <u>Meditating</u>
                        <br>
                        Mindfulness meditation is suggested to help with symptoms, by making the individual aware of their feelings, understanding them and accessing the resources within ourselves to overcome them. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <u>Staying active and exercising frequently</u>
                        <br>
                        Exercise is known to combat depressive moods and relieve other mental health issues. By exercising you help your brain cope better with stress.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <u>Improving sleep hygiene</u>
                        <br>
                        Sleepless nights can raise anxiety by 30%. Medical News Today informs that deep sleep is a natural anxiety inhibitor if we consistently rest every night.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Eating healthier
                        <br>
                        Food that has a beneficial impact on your brain includes salmon, chamomile, turmeric, dark chocolate, yoghurt, green tea, blueberries, citrus fruits, and chia seeds.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Avoid alcohol, caffeine and smoking
                        <br>
                        Smoking, alcohol and caffeine are known to worsen symptoms of anxiety. All three are mood-altering drugs which can amplify feelings of anxiety, nervousness, and alter our brain chemistry and cause changes in our moods. 
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h3>
                Therapy
            </h3>

            <p>
                Talk Therapy, a form of psychological counselling, involves collaborating closely with a therapist to reduce your anxiety symptoms. The most effective talk therapy and the most recommended is Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT). It is known to be a short-term form of therapy that focuses heavily on developing skills that improve how we deal with our symptoms. Depending on the case, CBT can expose the client to their triggers to help develop a way to overcome their symptoms. Usually, it is a one-to-one session, however, they can be group sessions with other individuals with similar symptoms as you.
                <br><br>
                
                CBT also aims to help you understand the overwhelming symptoms and break them down into smaller parts that are all interconnected. These smaller parts are:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Situations</li>
                    <li>Thoughts</li>
                    <li>Emotions</li>
                    <li>Physical Feelings</li>
                    <li>Actions</li>
                </ul>
           

            <p>
                Case Study: Taylor has just recovered from a bad car accident that had left her injured for weeks. Since returning home, she has shown irritability, restlessness, and panic at the mention of travelling anywhere. When she does attempt to drive, she freezes up and begins shaking. She refuses to leave the house and would rather walk everywhere. 
                <br><br>
                The thought of the previous car accident triggers a physical and emotional reaction, which leads her to walk or stay home rather than take the car.
                <br><br>
                From Taylor’s case, we can see what triggers her anxiety, and the negative thought processes that follow. 
                <br><br>
                By breaking down the triggers of your anxiety, CBT challenges the negative processes we have and encourages us to perceive our situation differently. A CBT therapist will encourage you to challenge your negative triggers to the point where you will be able to tackle them without their help. 
                <br><br>
                Case Study: In Taylor’s case, her CBT therapist may expose her to a controlled environment to reduce her avoidance and empower her to gain control of the situation and improve her confidence. 
                <br><br>
                This may include implementing a driving wheel in sessions and encouraging Taylor to hold it while imagining she is in the car. Together they will work through her processes by dividing them into the 5 small parts, with the therapist challenging each one patiently until Taylor can hold a wheel while managing her symptoms independently.
                <br><br>
                Additionally, the therapist will challenge her thought processes by reminding her that although she experienced this one-car accident, in the years since she gained her driving licence, she has never had an issue.
                <br><br>
                CBT is available both online or in a face-to-face setting with a CBT trained healthcare professional i.e., psychiatrist, psychologist, mental health nurse or GP. 
            </p>

            <h3>
                Medication
            </h3>

            <p>
                Those who experience extreme symptoms of anxiety may be prescribed medication from their doctor after an evaluation. Medications can range from short-term courses to long-term courses.
                <br><br>
                There are varied types of medication that can be used to reduce symptoms, which medication you may be prescribed is dependent on the type of anxiety disorder you are diagnosed with and any other mental and/or physical health issues you may already have.
                <br><br>
                Medications may include the following:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Antidepressants;
                        <br><br>
                        Work by increasing the level of serotonin in your brain. A low dose is recommended at the start of treatment, as it takes longer to take effect. Antidepressants can be taken over a longer period. 
Side effects include agitation, nausea, indigestion, loss of appetite, insomnia, headaches, and low sex drive.
                    </li>
                    <li>Benzodiazepines:
                        <br><br>
                        Is a type of sedative that is used for severe cases of anxiety. They are highly effective and can ease symptoms within 30 to 90 minutes after administration. Because they are highly addictive, they are only used for a shorter period.
Side effects include drowsiness, difficulty concentrating, headaches, vertigo, tremors, and low sex drive.

                    </li>
                </ul>

            <p>
                <br><br>
                Regular visits to your GP are recommended so the effects of the medication can be recorded. If the medication is not effective after a period, the GP will find the appropriate medication. 
                <br><br>
                If you are responding well and your symptoms improve, your GP will then slowly lower your dose of medication until you won’t need it anymore.
                <br><br>
                It is important to not stop your course of medication unless you have consulted with your GP, and they have advised you to.
